# BoxLabels

There was a need at work for a way to label packing boxes with information on the contents and the number of boxes being shipped. 

Originally, this information had been added to the boxes by hand and a more professional approach was required.

The information required on the boxes was:
  Product code, which is the same for all boxes.
  Works order number, which is the same for all boxes.
  The serial number of the first and last item in the box. These are sequential for each WO and start at 0001.
  The number of the box and the total number of boxes. e.g. Box x of y.
