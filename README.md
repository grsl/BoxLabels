# BoxLabels
## Despatch Labels for Packing Boxes.

This is a project for work. A colleague needs certain information printed on paper labels that are to be attached to boxes of goods that are sent to customers.

Some of the infomation is available in our manufacturing software and some needs to be input at the time of printing. 

## This required

 - Created a view on the database. 
 - The Word document needs to be changed so that it prints to the right printer. This will need to be set up on a per user basis.
 - The user's computer needs to have an ODBC connection to the database, in order to query the database view.

The data from the view is combined with the input data and, all the resultant data is output to an Excel spreadsheet.

The data is then added to a Word MailMerge document that is used to print the labels.
