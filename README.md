# BoxLabels
## Despatch Labels for Packing Boxes.

This is a project for work. A colleague needs certain information printed on paper labels that are to be attached to boxes of goods 
that are sent to customers.

Some of the infomation is available in our manufacturing software and some needs to be input at the time of printing. This required
creating a view on the database and setting up an ODBC to access the view. The data from the view is combined with the input data and
all the resultant data is output to an Excel spreadsheet.

Also, I created a Word Mail Merge document that pulls the resultant data from the spreadsheet and outputs the labels.
